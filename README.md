# kplug-website
San Diego Kernel Panic Linux User Group website, subsidiary of San Diego Computer Society

Alterations and additions to the KPLUG website requires switching to the gh-pages branch.
Main branch may contain files which are not served as webpages.

In general, any KPLUG member may contribute to the KPLUG website. Simply contact one of the listed org members to have your github account added as a valid member.

## Contributions may be made 2 main ways:
No matter what contributing method you use, it's highly advisable to deploy your handiwork on a local webserver for inspection first. Invoking a simple, small webserver already running your work is described in the Setup Guide.


* If you are a member of the default org group, you have full Admin permissions which include uploading changes directly to a repo. Note that if you do this, you are uploading directly to the repo, those changes take place immediately including any errors. If you are wary of showing the world what kind of mistakes you can make, use the next method instead. Because the website is built on a git versioning file system, faulty contributions can be undone, but until done your errors will be seen by the world.


* The preferred contributing method for anyone who is less than perfectly confident in their work is instead of cloning the kplug-website repo directly, to **Fork** the repo instead, creating your own github copy under your own git account. You can make changes to your forked copy, then when satisfied submit a **Pull** request on the original kplug-website account. Someone will evaluate your contribution, then possibly accept your **Pull** request, pulling in the changes from your online forked github copy.

See the website's own documentation for details about anything not described here.
